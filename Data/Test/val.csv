"** Perform a quantum chemical calculation using the def2-svp basis set with ""new"" polarization functions and the def2/j basis set as suitable for all def2 type basis sets, incorporating the popular B3LYP functional with 20% HF exchange. The calculation includes a selection of spin unrestricted SCF, a single point calculation, and the application of the RIJCOSX algorithm for efficient treatment of the Coulomb and Exchange terms. Additionally, strong SCF convergence criteria are applied along with minimal output, printing of basis set in input format, and printing of MO coefficients. Numerical Integration is performed using the first default grid points, Kollmar's DIIS is activated for SCF convergence acceleration, and the storage format for numbers is set to single precision for selected methods. The system under study is the nitrogen and fluorine molecule. **"|"! uks b3lyp sp def2-svp rijcosx def2/j strongscf miniprint printbasis printmos defgrid1 kdiis nososcf float

 Perform a quantum chemical calculation using the PBE0 density functional with D3BJ dispersion correction and the def2/J basis set for the [NH2] molecule. Ensure spin unrestricted SCF is selected, along with very tight SCF convergence criteria, and the efficient RIJCOSX algorithm. Do not attempt to start from an existing GBW file and set appropriate SCF convergence criteria for challenging cases. Utilize molecular symmetry, read MOs from a previous calculation, and work with the provided starting orbitals. Additionally, produce UHF natural orbitals and calculate unrestricted corresponding orbitals. Implement a heavier, higher-quality grid for the numerical integration close to the limit. Lastly, specify computation method for special grid atoms and grid integration accuracy. Remember to use the special EPR-III basis set. |"! uks pbe0 def2-tzvpp def2/j d3bj verytightscf rijcosx nofinalgrid noautostart slowconv usesym moread noiter uno uco defgrid3
