# TODO EXTRAPOLATION KEYWORDS
# Extrapolate (n/m, bas)@Extrapolation of the basis set family "bas" (bas=cc,aug-cc, cc-core, ano, sang-ano, aug-ano, def2; if omitted "cc-pVnZ" is used) for cardinal numbers n.m (n<m=2,3,4,5), e.g. Extrapolate(2/3,cc) extrapolates the SCF, MP2 and MDCI energies to the basis set limit. "core" refers to basis sets with core correlation function. In this case the frozen core approximation is by default turned off. This setting can be overridden in the "methods" block if one just wants to use the basis set with core correlation functions (steep primitives) but without unfreezing the core electrons.
# Extrapolate (n, bas)@Calculate the first n-energies for member of the basis set family basis, e.g. Extrapolate (3) is doing calculations with cr-pVDZ, ce-pVTZ and ex-pVQZ. Similar: performs SCF, MP2 and MDCI calculations. The higher basis set can only be done with DLPNO-CCSD(T) or MP2 methods and then used to extrapolate the MDCI calculation to the basis set limit.
# Extrapolate EP2 (n/m, bas, [method, method-details])s@Similar to EP2: for the high basis set method we go one cardinal number higher.
