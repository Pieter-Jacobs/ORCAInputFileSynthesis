%cis dcorr n # n=1-4. The meaning of the four algorithms is
# explained below.
# algorithm 1 Is perhaps the best for small systems. May use a
# lot of disk space
# algorithm 2 Stores less integrals
# algorithm 3 Is good if the system is large and only a few
# states are calculated. Saves disk and main
# memory.
# algorithm 4 Uses only transformed RI integrals. May be the
# fastest for large systems and a larger number
# of states
