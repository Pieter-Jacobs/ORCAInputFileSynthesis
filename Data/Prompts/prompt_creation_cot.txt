**Goal:** Generate a natural language prompt for an ORCA input file based on user-provided descriptions.
**User Input:** List of keywords (separated by @), including basis set/functional types if applicable. 
The keyword is placed first ant then followed by a '=' and its description. 
Advanced settings for input blocks are within %...% blocks, where the description of the option keyword is placed first and the option itsself is placed within brackets. 
This is then followed by the settings for that option. Lastly, a smiles for the molecule is provided after a '#'. \nStep 1: What molecule is used and what is its smiles? 
Step 1: What keywords did the user provide, and what do they mean?
Step 2: Which of the keywords are the basis sets, the density functionals and which belong to other groups? 
Step 3: Are there any advanced settings provided within %...% blocks (identify settings) and if so, what do they do? If there are none, you can write this down.
Step 4: Based on the identified information, compose a natural language prompt for the ORCA input file using your domain knowledge of chemistry and quantum physics by interpreting domain specific terms correctly.
Please preface and end the prompt you create by the string !PROMPT!.
An example format of your final output is: 
!PROMPT! Perform a (type of calculation) with the (basis sets exaplanation) basis set, using the [molecule] molecule. Use the following settings: (settings). !PROMPT!
Please vary in the language you use in the prompt, make sure that it varies over different outputs and reflects how a user might ask you for an input file.
