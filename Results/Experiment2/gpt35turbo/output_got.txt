---PROMPT---
 Perform a single point calculation with the def2-SVP basis set, which is a Valence double-zeta basis set with “new” polarization functions. Include correlation fitting for the def2-SVP orbital basis and Weigend’s “universal” Coulomb fitting basis suitable for all def2 type basis sets. Avoid using with ECPs beyond Kr. Use the RI-wB2PLYP density functional, optimized for excitation energies. Utilize the RI approximation. Set the efficient RIJCOSX algorithm and stringent SCF convergence criteria. Turn on Kollmar's DIIS for SCF convergence acceleration, but keep SOSCF off. Set the storage format for numbers to single precision. Employ a heavier, higher-quality grid for Numerical Integration, close to the limit of an enormous grid. #p(hashtag)p.
